# Alzheimers Disease Classification

### Alzheimers Disease

1. **Non-demented:** Individuals in this stage show no signs of dementia, maintaining normal cognitive function and independent daily living abilities without difficulty.

2. **Very Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI):** Often called "very mild demented," this stage presents subtle cognitive changes exceeding typical aging but not significantly affecting daily life. Occasional memory lapses or trouble finding words may occur, but independence remains intact.

3. **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI):** Also known as "mildly demented," this stage shows more noticeable cognitive changes interfering with daily function. Memory loss, confusion, and language difficulties may arise, but individuals can still manage most daily tasks independently.

4. **Moderate Alzheimer's Disease:** In this stage, cognitive decline intensifies, making independent task performance challenging. Memory loss worsens, recognition of people or places becomes difficult, and language and judgment issues arise. Behavioral symptoms like agitation and mood changes may also emerge prominently.
